A modern, responsive web application for browsing and discovering open aerial imagery from [OpenAerialMap](https://openaerialmap.org). Built with React, MapLibre GL, and Tailwind CSS.

**Live Dev Demo:** [https://cgiovando.github.io/oam-vibe-dev/](https://cgiovando.github.io/oam-vibe-dev/)

**Stable Version:** [https://cgiovando.github.io/oam-vibe/](https://cgiovando.github.io/oam-vibe/)

> **Note:** This is an experimental pilot application and does not yet fully replace the official [OAM Browser](https://map.openaerialmap.org/). See [Limitations](#known-limitations) for details.

- **MapLibre GL JS** - Map rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Turf.js** - Geospatial analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cgiovando/oam-vibe-dev.git
cd oam-vibe-dev

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Development

```bash
# Run development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### Deployment

The app is configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

This runs `vite build` and pushes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Configuration

### API Proxy

The app uses the OpenAerialMap API (`api.openaerialmap.org`).

**Why a CORS proxy is needed:** This application is currently deployed as an external pilot project outside the official OpenAerialMap domain. Since browsers enforce same-origin policies, direct API calls from `cgiovando.github.io` to `api.openaerialmap.org` are blocked by CORS. Once this application is integrated into the official OAM infrastructure and deployed under the `openaerialmap.org` domain, the CORS proxy will no longer be necessary, and the result limit can be increased significantly.

Current setup:
- **Development:** Vite proxies API requests locally to avoid CORS issues
- **Production:** Uses `corsproxy.io` as a CORS proxy (temporary solution)

The proxy configuration is in `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'https://api.openaerialmap.org',
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
    }
  }
}
```

### Result Limit

The number of images fetched per request is controlled by `RESULT_LIMIT` in `src/App.jsx`. Currently set to 50 to stay within the CORS proxy's response size limits. This limit can be raised (to 500+) once the app is deployed within the OAM stack without needing an external proxy.

## API Reference

This app uses the [OpenAerialMap API](https://api.openaerialmap.org):

- `GET /meta` - Fetch image metadata
  - `limit` - Number of results (default: 50)
  - `bbox` - Bounding box filter (minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat)
  - `order_by` - Sort field (e.g., `acquisition_end`)
  - `sort` - Sort direction (`asc` or `desc`)
  - `acquisition_from` / `acquisition_to` - Date filters
  - `platform` - Platform filter (satellite, uav, aircraft)

## Known Limitations

This is an **experimental pilot application** and does not yet fully replace the official [OAM Browser](https://map.openaerialmap.org/):

- **Missing Features:**
  - Image uploader (available at [upload.openaerialmap.org](https://upload.openaerialmap.org/))
  - User authentication
  - Image bookmarking/favorites
  - Full imagery catalog browsing (currently limited to 50 results)

- **Technical Limitations:**
  - **CORS Proxy Limits:** The production build uses `corsproxy.io` which has a 1MB response limit on the free tier. This is a temporary workaround until the app is deployed within the OAM infrastructure.
  - **Result Limit:** Currently limited to 50 images per request to avoid hitting proxy limits.
  - **No Pagination UI:** While the API supports pagination, the UI doesn't yet have "Load More" functionality.

## Future Plans

This project aims to eventually align with the [HOT Development Guide](https://docs.hotosm.org/dev-guide/intro/) standards for integration into the broader Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team ecosystem.
